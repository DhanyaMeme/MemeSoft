    " The passed 30 years, American manufacturing keep losing these precious blood to asian country , especially once the old fishing man pick the frozen snake after the massacre in 1989 , continue to give china CCP rule a unprecedented mercy and open policy , after several president miscalculation of the consequence of the manufacturing shift to china year by year, trumpeted by so called globalization of the theory of math , ignore all the other very important factor as human right by NGO, labour fairness by union, the cry of the middle class. Until the fully wake up by the covid epidemic . Realized it seems too late to change the tides . Even a simple PPE need to count on china supplier !",
    "The 2016 election reflect the consequence of such economic shift , middle class keep losing so much without hearing or making change to their voice. They become desperate to seek change for any voice promised or they can be easily manipulated by so, such historic events happened at all the communists Soviet , china, Vietnam , also Nazi German . History is repeating even stable american democracy could become fragile as Jan 6th insurrection to the Congress by creating any false claim and reject democracy election result . As professor at UC Berkeley and labour secretary Robert Reich said in 1997 , if the middle class keep eroding , whom will be the next target ? In 20 years we have all truth to approve on his righteousness!",
    " This is not a wake up call, the urgency is yesterday ! Rebuild up middle class by good pay manufacturing job become such urgency and important to the survival of our democracy and liberty, if American middle class keep declining , more chunk of the people will seek extreme method to change the country , the time of the totalitarian will happen by someone manipulate the situation , with propaganda and whitewash , the country could face much more serious issue than the Jan 6th insurrection and more polarized political , society , race and community, the country could be much more divided than today. Then there is no more peace and stability to anyone, extreme behaviors will wandering around , the richer and minority could be targeted seriously by the next , our democratic system could be fall out .",
    " The recent 10 years , especially the ambitious china 2025 industry plan , the growth at manufacturing at china made rapid progress , start to dominate many category of industry , not just medical . Usa and whole west allies start to loss the edge by 30 years unconscious good will or naïve to see the current situation. The good will of the blood sending hatch for liberty and democracy china turn to raise a very bully monster as today to use these advantage of manufacturing power to challenge not only international political and economic system but also much more strong totalitarian rules domestically. It start to shake the international security system for the rest of the nation. ",
    "We as industrial player really need to urge to put action to change the tide, reversal the supply chain to be back home , to seek the best cost effective solution with automation and dynamic supply system to gradually or rapidly once ready to shift the production back to the American workers , to support distress town and city to rebuild up their sustainable economic by good pay manufacturing job as the backbone of the society . To use the new tech knowledge to offset the high wage , to find the best supply chain and cost effective location to get the lowest cost structure , at certain way, we can beat imports Price to combined with design, products development , automation and swift supply chain. Surely there is always some products at any industry could have these elements , we can bring these product back to the home to produce as first thing first . We can convince brand and retail they can buy usa made products at similar as imports price . ",
    " But without brand and retail to support made in usa agenda , there is no chance to make it in real and substantial way , it require all the big brand and retail shall not be only view themselves as one inches from their cost nose, to achieve 25% of total purchase for made in usa within 10 years could be very feasible if the brand and retail has their sense of urgency , to invest 1-5% of the annual profit to open own factory or to invest with industries as partner , together it could make snowball way of the change within 10 years . Finally the balance of the american worker , society and brand , retail could be back at harmony status again , our democracy and constitution will be shining more , such mutual efforts worth for all as Paying a small fraction of tax for democ to win long term sustainability and national security of our nation . By so, every of us at industry should put action now !",

    "Visited Bradford UK in may 2022, the last visit is about 28 years ago, almost forgot what the city looks like , this was a wool capital of the world, I bought quite lots of British wool for china spinner in 1990s",
    " I contacted the economic development department at Bradford just several days ahead , Satnam as interim manager responsed and we made first quick meeting at Leads to arrange the next day visit to Bradford before I depart to France",
    "We visited salt mill after Satnam show me around the city center , certainly the wool exchange building , there is lots of apartment and building at city for sale. Each of them behind with long history and rich story to tell. Overall this is left behind city by now , I can feel the silent but also feel there is lots of eye at the air with the expectation . Can we bring the prospect again ? The loud and Glory ? As wool specialist , I can imagine the wool auction carry daily at the building at the old time , now as book store , the chaotic yield to bet each lot of the wool based on the sample. The vivid live around the city",
    " The opening ceremony of 2012 Olympic game at london, vivid showing how British transform the civilization to the industry era , leading the 1st industry revolution and joint leading the 2nd industry revolution. But I guess the initiative could happen after the awareness to limit King’s right as the “ Glory Revolution “ to cut off the landlord mindset of the belonging of everything , unlock the human freedom for all the other opportunity quite equally to every citizen instead of the few. Once the Walter invent the steam engines, human step into the modern era. Especially the first cotton spinning system become a common , the world is changing by British forever !.",
    " Once I walked around Bradford city, also the sadness feeling is around as well , the nation and people contribute so much for the civilization and modernization of the world . But today the self slip into a struggling economic status, need to patch the cloths at very charming glorious evening godown . I visited london ahead of the Bradford trip . I can feel the heritage and the modern mixed, well managed mega city. But I feel there is something missing beside of All the historic glorious , the most respected Queen Elizabeth. The most outstanding museum. Plus the Beatles. ",
    "From the movie of Dunkirt retreat, the darkest hour , I can feel the awful moment at history as British faced , the Second World War really hurt British, sucked the most reserves of fortune supposed for the future economic leadership but for the war , also left the states owned enterprise get the main stream after by the concentration of economy to fight the war. The afterwards hybrid economic model lost the flexibly and general entrepreneur flow spirit across the nation, last to 1980s , end up to do such big economic surgery and leads so many strikes and economic interruption, such shake up and consequence suffer, maybe the cost of these turnaround could save back the new innovation and leads to fully flow of marketing economic development, let entrepreneurs leads the next era of economic innovations and growth",
    " Unfortunately it falls into the hands of massive Globalization Wave, the new religious belief to be the only solution to make all better as theory , but it destroy the base of the good foundation of the established economy , the local manufacturing and related middle class community as the backbone of economy health as self sustainable and democracy foundation. End up , It creates more TAIPAN at each industry , suck all the rest of blood to be only for the few .",
    " Made the middle class ill as they lost the healthy wages made by the manufacturing job , transfer to be at so called service segment with the minimum wages as the poverty line",
    " By another hands , such good will utopian full village earth fall into the country with dictated leadership. Sucked the most valuable blood the extend the cruel ruling , give extra historic big chance to Create much more strong rival and enemy back , now even threat the national security",
    "The missing at the air is simply the manufacturing job , the solid incomes for each struggling family , rebuild up middle class is the the way to rebuild a solid and healthy nation with self sustainable , the last 30+ years of all the evidence and facts , approve any great ideology has the boundary to follow. The earth village is the utopian economic idea ,made huge mistake in reality , only leads to more uncertainty as todays world. Even leads to the 3rd world war no",
    " It is the urgent time to change dramatically to deny such big mistake , back to rebuild up The strong healthy economy of Britain, such urgency needs to be anytime ever. It is not only for the British , but also for the rest of civilization, to rebuild up a strong manufacturing economy as the new light house for the nation !",
    " Often heard about the expensive and costly to make here , no enough labour , no more skilled work force. To limit or discredit any efforts to bring the manufacturing job back to the country, certainly there is no quick solution , this is a slow mood to rebuild up manufacturing facility , anyone alone could not make it work . It should be all of people at industry to have such consensus and urgency to work together , behind it , we all need to be fully aware , this is very very serious 3rd world war but invisible , this like the white antes at your wood house . Once you saw it , feel it , it is way too late ! Time Now for fix it !",
    " for all consumer and any of us , we should use our purchase vote to ask all the brand and company to commit this , for the sake of our current life and the future generation , for the sake of the sovereign nation to be healthy and solid strong , with new tech knowledge support, with our commitment , we can scan all the products we are importing , find the 1st one at any category to put action on it , to plant the manufacturing new seeds on the category. We can make the change in the coming decade by all brand and company to commit to buy minimum 25% of the total purchase for made in UK within 10 years !",

    "Italy is the first country at EU I experienced at my first job in 1986 as the production and sales assistant, At export division handling angora fibre as the most important fibre beside cashmere to Italy as the top leading spinning and textile country ",
    "My first visit to Italy in 1994, came to visit Bella and Prato, everywhere is the spinning mills , factory is Running , business is busy as imagined",
    "In 2014 , I became a temporary resident at Milan. Spent almost one year to visit all kinds of factory not only spinning but also shoes and bags maker, obviously the town is changed , industry size is much smaller , factory only few left , many people left the industry, I met previous known person at spinning industry , some of them now work for Chinese spinner as manager or sales . ",
    "Just about 20 years , Italy lost the crown at spinning industry , lost almost 90% of the size , moved or failed under china spinner gain all the strength , today at yarn for sweater is fully dominated by Chinese spinner, only few italia spinner left . ",
    "Once the factory closed, there is many people flock to the service segment , but these service segment has no pay more than minimum wages, or luckily if there is job for so many people too, such drop affect many Italian and their families as anyone can imagines. ",
    "Maybe only Germany has lessee affection by such move , often the factory has the boards , workers sit in the chair of the boards , not easy to close without agreement , for some believe the fully free market, such structure of the set up looks like socialist but it works , prevent to the factory closure by one person decision , the rate of the factory closure far less than other western industry countries. Such company setup also worths the consideration from now on, The big Germany car and chemical company plays different cards at china , this is another story to discuss , believe all the Germany should feel the heats at the market, after so many years to provide joint venture or any kind of tech support, now at some area, Chinese company could compete with Germany teeth to teeth with much better cost effective position than Germany. ",
    "If all the optimism as the wishes to think about the profit and potential huge benefits could comes one day from huge Chinese population and market as a return to offset all the other negative perspective , or believe the china economy has only one way up , it will buy so many European made goods , eventually come up a win win situation as both could make big progress at economic way. ",
    "This is quite popular among many European business circle, often heard if there is 1% of Chinese buy their products, they will be billionaire overnight as another china dream as many had. Sometime I only can tell them to use 1PPM to replace the 1% if they are lucky. ( 1 of per million chance as PPM). But also once these order comes to the market , Chinese company will take the first bite too. If my friends does not understand the culture of Chinese history . ",
    "Once people lived at free world often has many dream for the good, forget there is devil under dictatorship rules , there is very sweet dream pill only for these free world people to support the devil by sake of the name of the people , this is also why European has less critical to anything happened at china, revise the bottom line one time by another. Find the reason to explain for the another worse situation for unfair competition and human rights violation. Same situation towards to the Russia side as well, wish all will be good later , with more sympathy rather than realizing the devil is just at the doorstep. The simple truth is : Take easy for the Crimean invasion by Russian, Until the recent big invasion to Ukraine , wake up call finally alarmed loudly !",
    "EU has 27 countries plus several candidates, there is so many difference between the countries in GDP and average incomes, this is great unification at human history toward the prospect for everyone at the region. Some EU country has such lower wage with educated work force and youth population , could bring so much economic power back to the whole EU for everyone benefit as the one market with very close democratic political system. ",
    "But such good will needs to be executed well , need to have much more policy behind to encourage EU brand or any international brand want to sell at EU to fit same goal to bring the prospection for all EU countries. To commit to Made in EU for 50% of the total purchase volume in the next 10 years. If failed, then additional Tax will apply ! ",
    "By another hands , all the EU consumer needs to be aware of these brand and company commitment to vote by purchase power, only buy these brand and company could make such commitment and make progress yearly towards such goal ! ",
    "Obviously there is some brand company already did and more than 50% or purely made in EU. But there is many more brands need to commit , such manufacturing job creation with new automation or even traditional artisan or home crafts could bring the much more chance for all EU people to take the chance to bring more incomes among the member states. Richer their own people and society , the whole EU became more sustainable and powerful ever than before. ",
    "Such strong EU at economic development among all member states by building up much more manufacturing capacity at own place is the backbone for the strong EU ever , put much solid of the rock foundation for the world peace and human prosperity at the earth. ",
    "By so, shall we wait ? or make action now ! ",

    "My first visit Japan in 1991, the glory and prospect of the Japanese time , everything is golden touched, the advanced technology perfect weaved with traditional culture , manner and clean everywhere. Shinkansen is the outstanding experience ever as the smooth and fast.",
    "Japan is leading all the category at Asia , from electronics to the Movie , music and design . The big mega trading house dominate many of the business worldwide. The whole Asia and most of the global influenced by Japanese products .",
    "Then as today , one o f six women at japan under poverty level , could not make even 1000 dollar a month. Almost every basic industry for life made in overseas , leave much less chance to domestic ordinary people to get chance to do manufacturing job to earn the good salary , instead of doing 800 yen of hourly service work , it never make the needs at the ends of even basic life",
    "Japan still keep lots of advanced technology at many industry area, by such massive normal people living at japan get less chance to gain more incomes and good pay jobs , it drives the economy at down spiral way as the consumer power get less and less by the less incomes, more rely on cheaper imports. More cheaper imports kills any more chance to make any kinds of factory domestically, bring less chance to the own people to gain more incomes.",
    "It is obviously said the cost to make in japan is much more expensive at the surface. Also to rebuild up the factory back for any goods require many support from every step of procedures , especially it needs both brand and company support as the key leading factor to turn this down spiral to be up spiral",
    "Government incentive also need to be there to offset some of initial cost as the high rent , or early training cost for staff and workers like 6 months. Also offer a package to any company regenerate job back to japan can get reward by end of year by the person hired if the wages could hit over 200,000 monthly and over.",
    "It is obviously said the people does not want to work as government gave them some support in monthly living payment , but how the people has the motivation to work if the pay is just similar as the government paid. The motivation needs to get start from double of the what people get from government, then it will make the move.",
    "Japanese craft , Japanese workers , Japanese people has the highest reputation for their craft spirit and hard working , most perfection detail at any of the products made , if the brand and company reposition and relook into these unbelievable advantage , push to build up a long term healthy community and bring back the prosperity to the society not just penny here and there for now, by the new technology of many automation actually invented by many Japanese company , any job creation at japan will make good impact and boost back the domestic economy. Also It could initial another wave of the Japanese export to the worldwide as the high reputation of made in japan.",
    "If every Japanese company could set up 1% of annual profit to be reshoring manufacturing funds to push forward, study the products to find out which product could be the first to bring back to made in Japan by update technology , not only creating the job back to the homeland, but also the final cost of the products could beat imports , this could be the great first step forward.",
    "Beside the rebuild up factory back Japan ,there is other many things could be explored as the craft of Japanese to boost the export level , give normal people chance to earn more money daily , weekly and monthly by support by local business people to help them for export , Japan was the biggest international trading country before. There is lots of people has such experience.",
    "There is still many previous factory building could be reused , create a good pay job for the local and attract people to move to small town And city , instead of becoming deserted area. Revitalize these area will bring much healthy element to the current Japanese economy , if these little here and there streaming together , it will be a big river to reborn again.",
    "A strong democratic Japan could not rely on only advanced technology, it must rely on the healthy society and most of them has the good healthy incomes for their life. It needs to be many way to regenerate the economy back to the positive side. Time to rebuild up the fishing gear for many ordinary people to go for the fishing by themselves again , to provide any kinds of support to the people to do any kinds of manufacturing domestically. This is only way to kick out the poverty and also self sustainable as a country.",
    "Without a healthy society with real middle class, there is no strong japan to the world to become strong balance power for the world peace . Such urgency is a very long time back due by lack of action . Now it is really matter to take action to change the course, wait and wait , talking and talking is obviously useless.",
    "My first visit Japan in 1991, the glory and prospect of the Japanese time , everything is golden touched, the advanced technology perfect weaved with traditional culture , manner and clean everywhere. Shinkansen is the outstanding experience ever as the smooth and fast",
    "Any of Japanese business leader need to put this at the top priority at the agenda, every things start from one , if you can add one more manufacturing job or one more chance to get one ordinary Japanese to make incomes from export of the products by made in Japan, it means much more than anything else.",

    "I met several factory owner at trade show in 2019,  they told me the precious 6 years , almost half of the factory gone after FTA with china. Then where these workers go ? Tourist ? More Chinese visitor to come to compensation,  or export resources like copper, ire ora , gold to china to compensation ? Or agriculture or alpaca to compensation for the losses ?  Not just the number , but also these factory workers incomes and then if not, the social payout after the factory closure ,  what is the real number after the self cheating FTA to think it will boost economic growth.",
    "Such situation repeated as cotton yarn era as the first industry revolution once the British spinner to flood India and destroy the whole cotton spinning industry by family base , the time is using military , now it just need a propaganda to cheat and self cheat to bring the nation economic down.",
    "I just got chance to be back the region recently ,  first I visited Uruguay as I am the wool specialist , was trading very large volume wool from Australian and New Zealand, never got chance to visit Uruguay. I have long time study on the project how to bring farmer to the market directly , eventually to change the whole industry as vertical control system by the few , provide a wholly new open market to let farmer lead the market. Create financial tool to them not need to sell short but still get the money to holds up the wool , eventually to shift the market to be at more stable level to protect the farmer got the money they deserve,  at another hands, all the industry player was at the driver seats,  now become service provider like test, packing  and logistic.  Uruguay is such perfect as not big but also there is no auction system yet, my platform could become a good tool there.",

Globalization does not bring the prosperity to the region , but eliminates more chance for the local and youth to apply.  Simply Asian is the only winner , china is the biggest dominates winner .  ",

Does Peruvian people benefit from the FTA as they can pay less of money to the Chinese car ?  The answer is obviously not equivalent by the number of people gain, and majority of the people losing . The luckiest part of Peru manufacturing has not been affected only because of the alpaca and Peruvian cotton as such special and unique, the Peruvian know the know how to handle this , but still quite small portion compare of the total manufacturing job losses after FTA with china.",

    "I feel the hope as this information approved for my long time thoughts ,  I put at trial at India to test the idea called Homecraft.TV ,  as wool specialist , yarn and  sweater expert, certainly to set up a hand knitting town at Uruguay is the first things first,  then by support the local hand knitters , to create a community , step by step to increase the size of the knitter , by the selling around world,  one piece by one piece, more and more people could join the force, then young people will join,  supplier will increase , designer will join , the eco system could rebuild up at scalable size,  then the spinner will comes back,  sweater and weave factory could come back, then the wool farmer could grow back the size.

Their price 30-50% higher than Chinese imports , even at USA market, by the small minimum like several hundreds pieces, to fast delivery , to the high quality of the making especially like active wear and swimwear, shape wear, they got their momentum at the USA market.   Plus these die hard made in Columbia local brand,  it support the local industry to persistence,  I visited total 7 factories,  each factory does have their own brand , this is quite impressive , they can sell own brand to gain more profit combined with private label to keep them survival and make certain profit to move forward.

Such key part rely on the platform of craft of Columbia to raise good funds to turn to support one by one to lead the final boost to all exporters at Columbia , the reputation of high quality made in Columbia, such move could be the great solution for the people and the country , eventually to boost enough economic energy to make the country take off to the next upper level , left the current stuck situation.
